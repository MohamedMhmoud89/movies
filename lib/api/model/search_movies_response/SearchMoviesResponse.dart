Partout dans le monde, les hommes jouent. Pour se dépasser, se mesurer, s'unir, s'illustrer ou créer le spectacle...  Le sport est l'un des plus petits dénominateurs du genre humain. Il se retrouve dans toutes les sociétés, toutes les cultures, toutes les classes sociales et à toutes les époques.

Construit comme un film \"opéra\" avec les plus belles images de sport tournées en très haute définition ou des archives récentes de grande qualité, PLAY repose sur la parole conjointe et entrelacée de grands champions internationaux et d'athlètes anonymes de sports méconnus. Un film qui témoigne de notre diversité mais aussi de ce qui nous relie.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iaK45xiyfJEOBVENpl0rTxnTkHZ.jpg","release_date":"2013-06-20","title":"Play","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/542sqGW2xH5EpyM3QJr7XuT7TyA.jpg","genre_ids":[18],"id":180526,"original_language":"es","original_title":"Play","overview":"A couple search for love but never quite seem to meet.","popularity":0.1217,"poster_path":"/wyhSHBzmh1MbR1whkIYSokXhdFk.jpg","release_date":"2005-09-07","title":"Play","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":9},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[16],"id":871366,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Play","overview":"Two guys are walking until one gets the idea to make a joke with the other.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2020-11-02","title":"Play","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/zRJ1CZ3XsQL0MRuzhuqROZBfFyS.jpg","genre_ids":[18,10402],"id":549953,"original_language":"fr","original_title":"Play","overview":"A dance music theatre piece that evokes the world of childhood and its careless pleasures.
